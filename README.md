[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karlgroves/express-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karlgroves/express-skeleton)

This is a basic, stubbed out Express application. It is not a real project or a real website, but a step-off point to get you started.

It contains stubbed out locations and example files for all templates, views, and Selenium tests.

DO NOT use the 'login' route as-is for session handling and authentication. You must modify this to use some sort of actual secure authentication. I tend to like PassportJS or Stormpath (or both together) for this.
